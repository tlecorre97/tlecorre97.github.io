excerpt: >
  This article proposes a decentralized algorithm to solve a mean field control problem for piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs), with application to the smart charging of large EV fleets. The authors prove convergence of a stochastic Uzawa algorithm in a non-convex setting with unbounded control intensities.
