excerpt: >
  This paper introduces a one-sided relaxation of optimal transport for distributed control, where the second marginal is constrained to a moment class. The approach, motivated by mean field control problems, includes entropic regularization and enables decentralized coordination without specifying a target distribution. Applications include electric vehicle charging under grid constraints, validated on a large real-world dataset.
